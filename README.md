<h1>About</h1>

Based only on _**HTML**_ and _**CSS**_, <br/> I have built a simple copy of Google.

**Live on: _https://viinario.github.io/Google-Search_**

This project has the <ins>same functionalities</ins> as found in the original Google. It's not only <ins>looks like google</ins> but it also <ins>works like Google</ins> by using the same original google search engine for the queries.

# Google Search Page

<h2> Interface </h2>

+ In google search page, I included the links to access Gmail, Google advanced search, Google image search, Produts and Login button in the top right corner.
+ In the same style as Google, I included links at the bottom of the page.
+ There are two buttons that work much like Google's buttons.
+ The search bar on this page is the same as in Google.

<h2> Workflow </h2>

 _The links at the top right of the page allow you to navigate to other pages._

There is a `search field` where you can enter your query and Google will take you to the results. 
 
 Use the `Google Search button` to find the result or use `I'm feeling lucky` to bypass the typical results page and go straight to the first Google search result for the query.
